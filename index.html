            <h1>Premier league Football</h1>
       <p><h3> the premier league is the top teir in english football or some say the world. 
            People believe this because there is so much more competitive nature in the premier league 
            compared to the seria a or laliga, i think this because in them other 2 leagues there are only 
            really 2 super teams who never loose but in england anyone can beat anyone, for example when leicter city
            won the premier league or when wolves got into europe for the first time ina very long time. But this also happens 
            in the other leagues in england like when sheffield united won promotion to the premier league for the first
            time in 12 years. they had only spent Â£6 million on players after getting promotion to the championship only 
            2  seasons before. In 2015 bradford city were 2-0 down to chealsea in the 4th round of the fa cup at the time 
            bradfrod was in the 3rd teir and chealsea were in the top but some how bradford pulled it back to win 4-2 against 
            the premier league team.</h3> </p> 

            <h1> Champions League </h1>
            <p><h3>The Champions League is the most sort after club trophy there is. It shows who the best team in europe 
                is with Real Madid winning it 13 times in their club history that is almost double second who is AC Milan
                 with 7 but double 3rd who are Liverpool with 6. There have been alot of upsets in the champions league
                 like in 2004 when AC Milan was 3-0 up at half time in Istanbul but Liverpool pulled it back to 3-3 and
                 then won on penalties Or when Porto won the Champions League in 2004 under the Iconic Jose Mourinho.
                </h3></p>
