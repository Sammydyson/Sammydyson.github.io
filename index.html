            <h1>Premier league Football</h1>
       <p><h3> The Premier League is the top teir in English football or some say the world. 
            People believe this because there is so much more competitive nature in the premier league 
            compared to the seria a or laliga, i think this because in them other 2 leagues there are only 
            really 2 super teams who never loose but in england anyone can beat anyone, for example when leicter city
            won the premier league or when wolves got into europe for the first time ina very long time. But this also happens 
            in the other leagues in england like when sheffield united won promotion to the premier league for the first
            time in 12 years. they had only spent Â£6 million on players after getting promotion to the championship only 
            2  seasons before. In 2015 bradford city were 2-0 down to chealsea in the 4th round of the fa cup at the time 
            bradfrod was in the 3rd teir and chealsea were in the top but some how bradford pulled it back to win 4-2 against 
            the Premier League team.man united are the record holders of the most titles of 20 but man city have won 
            it back to back making them one of the best.but the biggest upset was when leicter city defined all the odds 
            won the premier league under ranieri.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_football_champions"

            <h1> Champions League </h1>
            <p><h3>The Champions League is the most sort after club trophy there is. It shows who the best team in europe 
                is with Real Madid winning it 13 times in their club history that is almost double second who is AC Milan
                 with 7 but double 3rd who are Liverpool with 6. There have been alot of upsets in the champions league
                 like in 2004 when AC Milan was 3-0 up at half time in Istanbul but Liverpool pulled it back to 3-3 and
                 then won on penalties Or when Porto won the Champions League in 2004 under the Iconic Jose Mourinho. 
                 The most decorated player in the champions league is Francisco Gento winning it 6 times with Maldini winning 
                 it 5 times. One of the best teams who have never won the Champions League is Arsenal who have also never won the 
                 Europa League. Just last month Liverpool won the Champions League defeting Spurs 2-0 with a early penalty 
                 out away by Salah then a late goal scored by Origi.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League"

        <h1>championship</h1>
       <p><h3>
           This season in the championship has been entertaining like who will get religated and who would have the bottle 
           to clinch the final automatic spot. For the automatic it came down to the last 4 games Leeds was 3 points clear
           of sheffield united. It was sheffield united vs nottingham forrest the blades needed a victory and a strike from duffy
           in the second half put the blades one goal up before stevens doubling the lead with a well worked goal. 
           Now the pressure was on leeds to get a victory over relegation competitors wigan, leeds had a early penalty from a 
           hand ball and the wigan player was sent off but leeds couldnt convert it but minuets later patric bamford slots one home
           for the whites creating the 3 point gap, but wigan didnt give up, coming back and winning the game 2-1 with 10 men,
           this put the blades second on a massive goal difference. the blades then had hull a good side but 2 goals from david mcgoldrick
           and another goal from stevens  creates a 3 goal cushion before leeds played, leeds traveld to brentford looking to close the 
           gap only to be stunned by the hosts who won 2-0 this meant with 2 games left the blades had a 3 point cushion plus there 
           last game was againt relegated side ipswich if they won they would basically be up unless leeds closed a 13 goal difference
           the blades went on to win 2-0 and that was the race over leeds went on to draw againt aston villa. the last game of the seasons
           was agints stoke, the blades sold out the away end creating a party atmosphere but drew 2-2 with a late eaqualiser 
           coming from dowell. leeds had ipswich who shockingly lost from a keeper mistake in the last second to let ipswich win 2-1.
           aston villa won the play offs and nowrich won the championship by 5 points.

      <h1>who is The best player in the world?</h1>
      <p><h3> The biggest debate in world football is who is better messi or ronaldo? 
          both players are in the top 2 players of all time, both won 5 balondoors but ronaldo edges on goals but messi has more
           trophies by one.  all together both combined have won 59 trophies. Ronaldo has had a better international career winning
           2 trophies whilst messi has won no trophies with argentina. ronaldo has scored 631 beating messi. so overall there really
           isnt anything that seperates them except one thing. messi spent all his life at barcalona bur ronaldo did it in england the 
           best league in the world also spain and most recentlt italy with juventus <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/cristiano-ronaldo/leistungsdaten/spieler/8198"
